            This project implements a Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool with added features such as support for multiple languages, history tracking, and a reverse cipher option. It is written in Python and includes a simple command-line interface for user interaction. The tool not only encrypts and decrypts text but also provides a robust user experience with intuitive commands and clear outputs. By supporting multiple languages, it caters to a diverse user base, and the history tracking feature allows users to revisit previous encryption and decryption operations effortlessly. The reverse cipher option adds an extra layer of versatility, making this tool a comprehensive solution for various cryptographic needs. This project showcases my skills in Python programming, problem-solving, and my understanding of fundamental cryptographic concepts.
